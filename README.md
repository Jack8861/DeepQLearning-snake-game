# motive
I was totally unaware of how reinforcement learning works and wanted an handson experience in building a model so i chose to learn to build the popular snake game with reinforcement learning using a tutorial

- Now, i will be able to use reinforcement learning and my knowledge from pygame library to build other such reinforment learning based projects in the future.
- i have some ideas on a game using DeepQLearning technique so this was worth the while
